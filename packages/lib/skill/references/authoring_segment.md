# Authoring a Segment

## What a segment is

A segment is a self-contained TypeScript module that owns a DOM element and animates it. Segments are the building blocks of Videowright videos. Each segment lives in `segments/<id>/index.ts` and default-exports the result of `defineSegment()`.

Segments are shared across all videos. Any video's timeline can reference any segment. Do not duplicate a segment for a different video — parameterize it or extract shared parts into a component.

## `defineSegment`

Every segment is authored via `defineSegment()`. It validates the spec at runtime, brands the object, and returns a frozen `Segment`.

```ts
import { defineSegment } from 'videowright';

export default defineSegment({
  id: 'intro',
  advances: [3.0],
  voiceover: 'Welcome to the demo.',

  mount(el, ctx) {
    // Called when the player gives the segment its host element.
    // Set up DOM, attach components, register event listeners.
  },

  async play(ctx) {
    // Main animation/content logic. Required.
    // The segment decides when it is done via awaits on ctx methods.
    await ctx.hold(3000);
  },

  unmount() {
    // Called when the segment is removed. Clean up resources.
  },
});
```

## SegmentSpec fields

| Field | Required | Purpose |
|---|---|---|
| `id` | Yes | Unique identifier. Must match the folder name under `segments/`. |
| `advances` | Yes | Timing array for automated playback (render export; see below). |
| `voiceover` | No | VO text for this segment. Used by `videowright script` and shown in the HUD. |
| `notes` | No | Freeform notes. Not rendered anywhere. |
| `mount(el, ctx)` | No | Called when the player gives the segment its host `HTMLElement`. Set up DOM here. |
| `play(ctx)` | Yes | Main animation logic. Must return a `Promise<void>`. The segment ends when play resolves. |
| `unmount()` | No | Called when the segment is removed from the player. Clean up listeners, timers, WebGL contexts, etc. |
| `next()` | No | Override default next-press behavior. Return `true` to consume the press (internal beat), or `false` to let the player handle it normally. Omit the function entirely to use default behavior. |
| `prev()` | No | Override default prev-press behavior. Return `true` to consume the press, or `false` to let the player handle it normally. Omit the function entirely to use default behavior. |

## Lifecycle

1. **`mount(el, ctx)`** — The player creates a host `<div>` and passes it to the segment. The segment populates `el` with its DOM. This runs once per segment instance. `mount` is optional — if the segment only needs `play`, skip it.

2. **`play(ctx)`** — Runs after mount completes. This is where animation and timing happen. The segment controls its duration by awaiting `ctx.waitForNext()` and `ctx.hold(ms)`. When `play()` resolves, the segment is done and the player transitions to the next segment.

3. **`unmount()`** — Called when the player removes the segment (transition to next, or restart). Clean up any resources: event listeners, animation frames, WebGL contexts, audio nodes.

The `ctx.signal` (`AbortSignal`) is aborted when the segment is unmounted. Use it to cancel in-flight work (fetch requests, long-running loops) so they do not leak after the segment is gone.

## PlayerContext

The `ctx` object passed to `mount` and `play`:

| Method/Property | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `ctx.waitForNext()` | Pauses `play()` until the next user advance (interactive mode) or scheduled beat (render mode). Returns a `Promise<void>`. |
| `ctx.hold(ms)` | Pauses `play()` for the given duration in milliseconds. In render mode, resolves when the virtual clock advances past the requested duration (deterministic, no wall-clock dependence). Returns a `Promise<void>`. |
| `ctx.signal` | `AbortSignal` — aborted when the segment is unmounted. Wire this to fetch calls, animation loops, or anything that should stop when the segment leaves. |
| `ctx.mode` | `'interactive'` (dev server) or `'render'` (export pipeline). Segments can branch on this if needed. |
| `ctx.clock()` | Milliseconds since this segment was mounted. In render mode, returns deterministic time based on frame count. In interactive mode, returns wall-clock elapsed. |

### Timing: `waitForNext` vs. `hold`

Use **`ctx.waitForNext()`** for content beats — points where the visual advances to match a voiceover cue (or the user's manual advance in dev mode). This creates a pause that the user steps through with Space / Right Arrow in dev mode, and the export pipeline drives with the `advances` timing.

**`waitForNext()` is the voiceover alignment primitive.** Place a `waitForNext()` at every point where the visual should sync to a voiceover cue — each section reveal, each bullet point, each stat highlight. This decouples segment authoring from any specific voiceover recording: swapping narration only requires new timing data (a different `Timing` in the voiceover), not rewriting the segment code. If you instead bake VO-specific durations into `hold()` calls, the segment is married to one narration and must be re-authored to accommodate a different voice, pacing, or language.

**Rule of thumb:** if you are deciding between `waitForNext()` and `hold()` for a content reveal, ask: "Would a different voiceover want to trigger this at a different time?" If yes, use `waitForNext()`.

Use **`ctx.hold(ms)`** for timed pauses that are internal to a beat — entrance animation lead-in, dwell time after a reveal before the next interactive point, or inserting a gap between logical phases that should always take the same amount of time regardless of voiceover. In dev mode, `hold` waits real time. In render mode, `hold` resolves when the virtual clock advances past the delay — identical semantics to dev mode but driven by the deterministic frame clock.

`ctx.hold(ms)` is deterministic in render mode, so `for...await ctx.hold(N)` mutation loops fire across distinct frames as expected. For smooth sub-frame interpolation (eased motion), WAAPI or CSS animations remain preferred — hold-driven loops are best for stepped/discrete state changes.

`setTimeout`/`setInterval` are virtualized by the render shim and fire deterministically; you may use them freely. Prefer `ctx.hold(ms)` for control-flow pauses since it participates in the structured `play()` flow and respects segment teardown.

### Render-safe animation patterns

Render mode uses a **virtual clock** that the render driver advances frame by frame between captured screenshots. The render shim virtualizes all timer primitives: `performance.now()`, `Date.now()`, `setTimeout`, `setInterval`, and `requestAnimationFrame` all reflect deterministic virtual time. WAAPI and CSS animations also run on the document timeline, which the render driver controls.

#### Patterns and recommendations

All of the following patterns work deterministically under the render shim. WAAPI is preferred for DOM animation because it provides smoother sub-frame interpolation and requires less code, but these alternatives are acceptable — especially for stepped/discrete state changes.

**1. `await ctx.hold(N)` in a mutation loop** — works deterministically; each iteration fires on a distinct frame. Prefer WAAPI for smooth eased animation (e.g., typing effects with per-character opacity fade), but hold loops are fine for discrete state changes:
```ts
// Works: typing animation with hold loop (stepped reveal, no easing)
async play(ctx) {
  const el = host!.querySelector('[data-ref="text"]') as HTMLElement;
  const text = 'Hello, world!';
  for (let i = 0; i <= text.length; i++) {
    el.textContent = text.slice(0, i);
    await ctx.hold(50); // each iteration advances virtual time by 50ms
  }
}
```

**2. `setTimeout` / `setInterval`** — virtualized by the render shim, fires at the correct virtual time. Prefer `ctx.hold(ms)` for control-flow pauses (abort-signal integration), but `setTimeout` is fine for fire-and-forget scheduling:
```ts
// Works: delayed class addition via setTimeout
setTimeout(() => el.classList.add('visible'), 500);
```

**3. `performance.now()` / `Date.now()` for animation progress** — virtualized by the shim; returns deterministic virtual time. `ctx.clock()` is preferred for semantic clarity (it clearly communicates "time since segment mount"), but raw timer reads also work:
```ts
// Works: manual rAF loop with performance.now()
const start = performance.now();
function tick() {
  const t = (performance.now() - start) / 1000;
  mesh.rotation.x = t * 0.25;
  requestAnimationFrame(tick);
}
requestAnimationFrame(tick);
```

**4. Custom `requestAnimationFrame` loops with deltaTime** — rAF timestamps are virtualized, so deltaTime calculations produce correct deterministic results. `ctx.clock()` is still preferred for Three.js/WebGL scenes (clearer intent):
```ts
// Works: deltaTime from rAF timestamps
let last = 0;
function tick(now: number) {
  const dt = now - last;
  last = now;
  position += velocity * dt; // dt reflects virtual time
  requestAnimationFrame(tick);
}
requestAnimationFrame(tick);
```

#### Prescribed patterns

**1. WAAPI for DOM animations** (the default choice):
```ts
// GOOD: WAAPI animations run on the document timeline — render-safe
el.animate(
  [
    { opacity: 0, transform: 'translateY(20px)' },
    { opacity: 1, transform: 'translateY(0)' },
  ],
  { duration: 500, fill: 'forwards', easing: 'ease-out' },
);
```

Prefer WAAPI `delay` to stagger multiple animations over `ctx.hold()` between them (less code, smoother easing):
```ts
// GOOD: staggered entrance using WAAPI delay — render-safe
const items = host!.querySelectorAll('.item');
items.forEach((item, i) => {
  (item as HTMLElement).animate(
    [
      { opacity: 0, transform: 'translateY(16px)' },
      { opacity: 1, transform: 'translateY(0)' },
    ],
    { duration: 400, delay: i * 80, fill: 'forwards', easing: 'ease-out' },
  );
});
```

**2. CSS animations and transitions** declared in CSS or set via `el.style.animation`:
```ts
// GOOD: CSS animation — runs on document timeline, render-safe
el.style.animation = 'fadeIn 0.5s ease-out forwards';
```

**3. WAAPI for typing animations** — use per-character `delay` instead of a mutation loop:
```ts
// GOOD: typing animation using WAAPI delay-per-character — render-safe
mount(el) {
  const text = 'Hello, world!';
  el.innerHTML = text
    .split('')
    .map((ch) => `<span style="opacity:0">${ch === ' ' ? '&nbsp;' : ch}</span>`)
    .join('');
},

async play(ctx) {
  const chars = host!.querySelectorAll('span');
  chars.forEach((ch, i) => {
    (ch as HTMLElement).animate([{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }], {
      duration: 1, // near-instant per character
      delay: i * 50, // 50ms between each character
      fill: 'forwards',
    });
  });
  await ctx.waitForNext();
}
```

**4. `ctx.clock()` for time-derived values** — returns deterministic milliseconds in render mode:
```ts
// GOOD: Three.js driven by ctx.clock() — render-safe
async play(ctx) {
  function tick() {
    if (ctx.signal.aborted) return;
    const t = ctx.clock() / 1000; // seconds since mount, deterministic in render
    mesh.rotation.x = t * 0.25;
    mesh.rotation.y = t * 0.15;
    renderer.render(scene, camera);
    requestAnimationFrame(tick);
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(tick);
  await ctx.waitForNext();
}
```

**5. Lottie — drive frames manually via `ctx.clock()`** instead of letting lottie-web run its own rAF loop:
```ts
// GOOD: Lottie with manual frame drive — render-safe
async play(ctx) {
  const anim = lottie.loadAnimation({
    container: host!,
    animationData: data,
    autoplay: false, // critical: disable internal rAF loop
  });

  function tick() {
    if (ctx.signal.aborted) return;
    anim.goToAndStop(ctx.clock(), false); // ctx.clock() returns ms
    requestAnimationFrame(tick);
  }
  requestAnimationFrame(tick);
  await ctx.waitForNext();
}
```

**6. Three.js — prefer `ctx.clock()` over `performance.now()`** for time-derived values (rotation, position, shader uniforms). `performance.now()` also works under the shim; `ctx.clock()` is preferred for semantic clarity (segment-relative time):
```ts
// GOOD: Three.js scene driven by deterministic clock
const t = ctx.clock() / 1000;
mesh.position.y = Math.sin(t * 2) * 0.5;
```

#### When `ctx.hold()` is the right choice

`ctx.hold()` is idiomatic for:
- **Control-flow pauses** — waiting a fixed time before calling `ctx.waitForNext()`, or inserting a gap between logical phases of a segment.
- **Stepped/discrete state changes** — typing out characters, revealing list items one by one, or any mutation loop where each step is a distinct visual state rather than a smoothly interpolated motion.

For smooth eased animation (opacity fades, position tweens), prefer WAAPI — it provides sub-frame interpolation that hold-driven loops cannot.

### Percentage-based timing within beats

**Strong default:** express `hold()` durations inside a beat or sub-segment as a percentage of the beat's total time rather than fixed millisecond values.

When a voiceover changes — even slightly — every segment's beat durations shift. If the animations within a beat use hardcoded millisecond timers, those timers no longer fit the new beat length: an animation that filled 80% of a 4-second beat now overruns a 3-second beat, or leaves dead air in a 5-second beat. Percentage-based timing adapts gracefully because the durations scale with the beat.

A typical pattern: compute the beat duration from context (e.g., the total hold time allocated to the current phase), then derive individual timers as fractions of it.

```ts
// GOOD: timers scale with beat length
const beatMs = 3000; // total time for this phase
await ctx.hold(beatMs * 0.2);  // entrance animation: 20% of beat
items.forEach((item, i) => {
  (item as HTMLElement).animate(
    [{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }],
    { duration: beatMs * 0.15, delay: beatMs * 0.25 + i * (beatMs * 0.1), fill: 'forwards' },
  );
});
await ctx.hold(beatMs * 0.8);  // remaining time for content display

// AVOID: fixed timers break when beat length changes
await ctx.hold(600);
items.forEach((item, i) => {
  (item as HTMLElement).animate(
    [{ opacity: 0 }, { opacity: 1 }],
    { duration: 450, delay: 750 + i * 300, fill: 'forwards' },
  );
});
await ctx.hold(2400);
```

This is a best practice, not a hard rule. Fixed timers are appropriate when the duration is truly independent of the beat — e.g., a 200ms micro-interaction that should always feel the same speed. But as a default posture, reach for percentages.

**Related smell:** if you find yourself tweaking `hold()` values inside a segment to match a specific voiceover's pacing, that is a sign the beat boundaries are wrong. The content that needs to align with the voiceover should be gated by its own `waitForNext()` call so the timing comes from the `advances`/`Timing` data, not from hardcoded milliseconds. See [voiceover.md § VO-alignment smell](voiceover.md#vo-alignment-smell) for more detail.

## The `advances` array

Every segment must declare an `advances` array. It tells the render export pipeline when to fire each advance during automated playback.

Each entry is a **segment-relative time in seconds** at which the driver fires a `triggerNext()`. The array must be **monotonically increasing** and contain only **positive numbers**.

### How `advances` maps to `waitForNext` and `hold`

The length of `advances` equals the **total number of triggerNext() presses** needed to traverse the segment, **including the final press that transitions to the next segment**.

**Example 1: hold only**

```ts
async play(ctx) {
  await ctx.hold(3000);  // 3 seconds of animation
}
// play() resolves after hold completes -> 1 press needed to move to the next segment
// advances: [3.0]
```

One advance at 3.0s. After the hold completes and `play()` resolves, the export driver fires triggerNext at t=3.0s, which causes the player to transition to the next segment. The advance does not cause the hold — the hold runs on its own clock and the advance fires afterward to move past the segment.

**Example 2: one interactive beat**

```ts
async play(ctx) {
  // Show title
  await ctx.waitForNext();  // 1 press: reveals content
  // Show content
  await ctx.hold(2000);     // 2 second animation
}
// play() resolves -> 1 more press to move to next segment
// advances: [1.5, 4.0]
```

Two advances: first press at t=1.5s reveals content, second press at t=4.0s moves to the next segment.

**Example 3: multiple interactive beats**

```ts
async play(ctx) {
  await ctx.waitForNext();  // 1: reveal point A
  await ctx.waitForNext();  // 2: reveal point B
  await ctx.hold(1000);     // 1 second hold
}
// play() resolves -> 1 more press to move to next segment
// advances: [2.0, 4.0, 6.0]
```

Three advances total. Each waitForNext consumes a press, and the final press after play resolves transitions out.

### Key rules

- `advances` is **required** on every segment. `defineSegment` throws if it is missing or empty.
- Values must be **positive** and **monotonically increasing**.
- The array length determines how many presses the export pipeline fires for this segment.
- `advances` is used in render mode (deterministic export). In interactive dev mode, the user's key presses drive timing.

## Internal beats with `next()`

For segments that need sub-steps (e.g., a list that reveals items one by one), use the `next()` override.

Note: `defineSegment()` freezes the returned object, so you cannot store mutable state on `this`. Use closure-scoped variables instead:

```ts
let items: NodeListOf<Element>;
let revealed = 0;

export default defineSegment({
  id: 'feature-list',
  advances: [1.5, 3.0, 4.5, 6.0],

  mount(el) {
    el.innerHTML = '<div class="item">A</div><div class="item">B</div><div class="item">C</div>';
    items = el.querySelectorAll('.item');
    revealed = 0;
  },

  next() {
    if (revealed < items.length) {
      items[revealed].classList.add('visible');
      revealed++;
      return true;  // consumed — stay on this segment
    }
    return false;  // not consumed — let the player advance to next segment
  },

  async play(ctx) {
    // play can just hold while next() handles the reveals
    await ctx.hold(6000);
  },
});
```

When `next()` returns `true`, the press is consumed as an internal beat — the player does not transition. When it returns `false`, the player handles the press normally (moves to next segment or resolves a pending `waitForNext`).

## Idempotency

Segments should be safe to mount and unmount multiple times. This happens when:

- The user navigates backward and forward through the timeline.
- The player restarts.
- The dev server hot-reloads.

Rules:

- Do not assume `mount` is called only once per page load.
- Clean up everything in `unmount()` — event listeners, DOM mutations outside `el`, global state.
- Use `ctx.signal` to abort in-flight work when the segment is unmounted mid-play.

## Any web tech is welcome

Segments own their DOM. Inside a segment, use whatever fits:

- **CSS animations and transitions** for simple motion. Render-safe -- they run on the document timeline.
- **GSAP** for complex timeline-based animation. Render-safe when using its document-timeline mode.
- **Three.js / WebGL** for 3D scenes. Drive time-derived values with `ctx.clock()`, not `performance.now()`. See render-safe patterns above.
- **Lottie** for After Effects animations. Use manual frame drive with `ctx.clock()` (`autoplay: false`, `anim.goToAndStop(ctx.clock(), false)`). See render-safe patterns above.
- **Animated SVG** for vector graphics. Use WAAPI or CSS animations for SVG element animations.
- **React / shadcn** for component-driven UI (attach to `el` via `createRoot`).
- **echarts / D3** for data visualization.
- **Canvas 2D** for pixel-level control. Use `ctx.clock()` for time-derived drawing.

If you need DOM isolation (e.g., to avoid CSS conflicts), attach a shadow root to `el`:

```ts
mount(el) {
  const shadow = el.attachShadow({ mode: 'open' });
  shadow.innerHTML = `<style>/* scoped styles */</style><div>...</div>`;
}
```

## Visual sizing — fill the frame

Video is not a web page. There is no scrolling, no responsive reflow, no "above the fold." Every frame is a fixed canvas (typically 1920x1080) and the viewer sees exactly what is rendered. Treat every pixel as valuable.

### Rules

- **Text must be legible at playback size.** If a viewer watching the video at its native resolution cannot comfortably read the text, it is too small. Headings, stats, labels, and body copy should be generously sized. A good baseline: body text should be at least 36px at 1080p; headings should be 64px or larger. These are minimums — go bigger when the content allows.
- **Use the full canvas.** Content should fill the frame. Avoid excessive margins, padding, or whitespace that pushes the visual into a small centered region. A segment showing a single stat or a short heading should scale that content up to dominate the frame, not float it in the middle at web-scale sizes.
- **If text is too small to matter, remove it.** Tiny footnotes, fine-print labels, or decorative micro-text that cannot be read serve no purpose in a video. Either make the text large enough to read or omit it. Small decorative labels are acceptable only when they are an intentional style element (e.g., a HUD aesthetic with tertiary metadata), not a default choice.
- **Margins are intentional design, not defaults.** When a style calls for breathing room (e.g., editorial layouts with generous whitespace), that is a deliberate aesthetic choice documented in the style's STYLE.md. The default posture is to fill the frame, and whitespace should be a conscious decision, not an accident of web-scale CSS habits.
- **Test at actual video resolution.** Run `npx videowright dev` and check whether the content fills the player viewport. If elements look small or lost in empty space, increase sizes.

### Common mistakes

| Mistake | Fix |
|---|---|
| `font-size: 16px` or `1rem` on body text | Use `36px`+ for body, `64px`+ for headings at 1080p |
| `max-width: 800px; margin: 0 auto` (web-page centering) | Remove max-width constraints or set them close to the video width. Use `width: 90%` or `padding: 40px` instead. |
| Small centered card with large empty background | Scale the card to fill 80-90% of the frame, or use the background intentionally (texture, animation, gradient) |
| Bullet list with small text and huge line spacing | Increase font size, reduce line count if needed, fill the frame |
| Container widths set too conservatively | Use `width: 80%`+ for primary content containers; `90%`+ is often appropriate. Prefer `%` over `vw`/`vh` for consistency with the rules above. |

## Using style tokens

Segments consume the active style's design tokens via CSS custom properties: `var(--color-accent)`, `var(--font-display)`, etc. Segments do **not** import `tokens.css` themselves — the timeline-level import provides the variables at runtime via `:root` custom properties.

This means one segment can be reused across videos with different styles. The CSS variables resolve to whatever the video's timeline imported.

See [styles.md](styles.md) for the full token system and recommended token set.
